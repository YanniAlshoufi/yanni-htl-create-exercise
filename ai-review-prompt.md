# Review a score-based tic-tac-toe game

You should grade a student's code for a score-based tic-tac-toe game based on the following criteria:

- Completeness: Are all the required features implemented?
- Code quality: Is the code clean, well-structured, and maintainable?
- Correctness: Is the game compliant to [exercise.md](exercise.md)? E.g., are there actually precise enough error messages for the parser, etc.
- Functionality: Does the game work as expected, including all specified features?

Score all of these using the Austrian grading system (1-5, where 1 is the best and 5 is the worst). Provide a detailed explanation for each grade and the total grade.

## Technologies

- ASP.Net for the backend
- Angular for the frontend
- Auto-generated Angular API services for communication between frontend and backend
- SQLite and EFCore for the database

## Output format
